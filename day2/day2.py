# Problem 1:
# Write a Python program to add two numbers
a = 10
b = 5
sum = a + b
print("Sum of", a, "and", b, "is:", sum)


# Problem 2:
# Write a Python program to find remainder when a number is divided by 2
number = 17
remainder = number % 2
print("Remainder when", number, "is divided by 2:", remainder)


# Problem 3:
# Check the type of the variable assigned using input() function
user_input = input("Enter something: ")
print("You entered:", user_input)
print("Type of the input is:", type(user_input))


# Problem 4:
# Use comparison operators to find whether a is greater than b or not
a = 34
b = 80
print("Is a greater than b?", a > b)


# Problem 5:
# Write a Python program to find average of two numbers entered by the user
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
average = (num1 + num2) / 2
print("Average of the two numbers is:", average)


# Problem 6:
# Write a Python program to calculate square of a number entered by the user
num = float(input("Enter a number to find its square: "))
square = num ** 2
print("Square of", num, "is:", square)

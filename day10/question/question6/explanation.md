Yes, in Python, you **can** change the `self` parameter to **any valid variable name**, like `slf`, `rishabh`, `this`, etc.

### 🔍 Important Point:

`self` is **not a keyword** in Python. It’s just a **convention** that refers to the current instance of the class. Python only cares that the **first parameter in an instance method refers to the object itself**—you can name it whatever you want.

### ✅ Example using `self` (standard):

```python
class Example:
    def show(self, name):
        print("Hello", name)
```

### ✅ Same functionality using `rishabh` instead of `self`:

```python
class Example:
    def show(rishabh, name):
        print("Hello", name)
```

Both work the same when you run:

```python
obj = Example()
obj.show("Rishabh")
```

### Output:

```
Hello Rishabh
```

---

### ✅ Another example with full class:

```python
class Train:
    def __init__(rishabh, name, seats):
        rishabh.name = name
        rishabh.seats = seats

    def book_ticket(rishabh):
        if rishabh.seats > 0:
            print(f"Ticket booked on {rishabh.name}")
            rishabh.seats -= 1
        else:
            print("No seats available")

    def get_status(rishabh):
        print(f"{rishabh.name} has {rishabh.seats} seat(s) left")

train = Train("Rajdhani Express", 3)
train.get_status()
train.book_ticket()
train.get_status()
```

### Output:

```
Rajdhani Express has 3 seat(s) left
Ticket booked on Rajdhani Express
Rajdhani Express has 2 seat(s) left
```

### 🧠 Conclusion:

* ✅ You **can** rename `self` to anything (`slf`, `rishabh`, etc.).
* ❌ But it’s **not recommended**, especially in real-world projects.
* ✅ Stick to `self` to follow community standards and make your code readable for everyone.
